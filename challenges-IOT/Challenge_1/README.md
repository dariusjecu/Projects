 Game Mechanics

	The main purpose of the game is to swich of all the leds from the board. You have a player who can be controled with button B and it can shoot with lasers with button A. You have just 13 projectiles, so be sure do not miss to much. :))

	When you switched off all the leds except the led wich is the player, you win the game. If there are 1 or more leds turned on and you do not have projectiles anymore, YOU LOSEEEE!!!!!!

	Have fun!
